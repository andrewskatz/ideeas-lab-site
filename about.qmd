In the IDEEAS Lab, our research focuses on the development and application of data science, machine learning, and natural language processing methods to engineering education research. We are particularly interested in the use of these methods to improve the decisions throughout engineering education agents and systems. Right now some of those areas include assessment, engineering ethics, and environmental sustainability education, but we are always looking for new areas to explore and cooking up new ideas.

You will find more information about research projects here soon...
