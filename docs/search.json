    "text": "Background information\nThis document is intended to provide background information for students who are interested in joining my research group. You will find information about the research we do, the tools we use, and the logistics of getting involved.\n\n\nConceptual Information\nThis is material to help you start understanding basic concepts in machine learning and natural language processing, which we use in the research group. Here are some resources to get you started. There are many more resources available online, but these are some of my favorites. They include written tutorials and videos.\nWritten tutorials The blogs from Jay Alammar are excellent. Here are some of my favorites:\nSome basics are:\n\nMath of neural networks: The Non-Technical Guide to Machine Learning & Neural Networks\nThe Illustrated Transformer\nThe Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and co.\nThe Illustrated GPT-2\nThe Illustrated GPT-3\n\nHere are some video resources:\n\nMachine Learning\nNatural Language Processing\nDeep Learning\nRecurrent Neural Networks from a Stanford course on computer vision\nLong Short-Term Memory from StatQuest, which is a great youtube channel for learning about machine learning and statistics\nGated Recurrent Units\nAttention from Andrew Ng, one of the pioneers of deep learning\nTransformer Networks\nBERT\nGPT-3 From Yannic Kilcher’s excellent youtube channel\nGPT-3 Demo\nGPT-3 Demo 2\n\n\n\nLogistics and Admin Information\nThis is material for actually getting involved in the research.\n\nIRB training: The university uses the CITI training system for IRB training. You can find the training here. You will need to create an account and then complete the training. You will need to complete the “Social and Behavioral Research Investigators” training. You will also need to complete the “Responsible Conduct of Research” training. More information is available on the university IRB website.\nUsing github copilot We will use github copilot for assistance with coding. You can find information about github copilot here. You will need to create a github account and then request access to copilot. You can find information about requesting access here. As a student, you should be able to get access for free. You should be able to use copilot in VS Code, which is the IDE we will use for coding. You can find information about VS Code here.\nUse of Teams We will also use Microsoft Teams for communication. You can find information about Teams here. You will need to create a Microsoft account to use Teams. You can be added to the research group’s team once you have created an account and emailed Dr. Katz.\nIDPro If you want to join research for course credit, you will need to register for the interdisciplinary projects (IDPro) course that meets either Wednesday or Thursday evening 5:30-7:20 (only one night, not both nights). Talk to Dr. Katz if you are interested in this option."

    "text": "Dr. Katz is an assistant professor in the Department of Engineering Education at Virginia Tech. He leads the Improving Decisions in Engineering Education Agents and Systems (IDEEAS) Lab. In order to make this slightly less bizarre, I am going to stop the third person narrative, be realistic, and switch to first person.\nI completed my PhD in the School of Engineering Education at Purdue University in spring of 2019. I was there for two years after having actually started my doctoral studies at Virginia Tech in Fall 2015. My advisor was Dr. Donna Riley, so when she moved to Purdue to lead the School of Engineering Education there I moved along with her. I was fortunate enough to be supported by an NSF graduate research fellowship, which made the transition a little more feasible since that funding tends to be tied to the student fellow rather than their particular institution of study. For that project (and my dissertation), I studied engineering faculty member mental models of engineering ethics education. I had started graduate school interested in student moral development, but within the first month of the program realized that if faculty members do not change then any sweet research I did on students may not amount to anything. Consequently, I switched to studying faculty members. These days I tend to have an interest in both faculty members and students and go wherever the research problem suggests.\nBefore starting starting my doctoral work in engineering education, I bounced around a little more than some people. For example, I taught physics (AP Physics I, AP Physics C Mechanics and E&M) at a high school in Dallas, Texas for a couple of years. Before that, I worked as an environmental engineer in Research Triangle Park, NC helping research and write air pollution regulations. That was preceded by a short stint in the Gillings School of Global Public Health at UNC where I was studying health effects of inhalation exposure to small particles in exhaust gas. Of course, I was interested in that from my master’s degree in environmental engineering at Texas A&M University, where I focused more on water pollution and epigenetic effects of exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds. I also hold a bachelor’s degree in chemical and biomolecular engineering from Tulane University."
