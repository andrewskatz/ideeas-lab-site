# Background information
This document is intended to provide background information for students who are interested in joining my research group. You will find information about the research we do, the tools we use, and the logistics of getting involved.

 

# Conceptual Information 

This is material to help you start understanding basic concepts in machine learning and natural language processing, which we use in the research group. Here are some resources to get you started. There are many more resources available online, but these are some of my favorites. They include written tutorials and videos.
